# Production Cleanup - COMPLETED

## Final Cleanup Tasks Completed

### 🧹 **Additional Code Cleanup**
1. **Client package.json**: Removed unused scripts
   - Removed `deploy:staging` and `verify` scripts that referenced non-existent files
   - Cleaned up to essential scripts only: `dev`, `build`, `lint`, `preview`

2. **Server wsgi.py**: Production optimization
   - Removed excessive debug print statements (12 statements)
   - Fixed `application.app_context()` bug → `app.app_context()`
   - Streamlined initialization with minimal logging
   - Maintained error handling for production safety

3. **Server run.py**: Simplified database initialization
   - Removed verbose debug logging and complex fallback logic
   - Streamlined to production-appropriate error handling
   - Reduced from 140 lines to 47 lines (67% reduction)
   - Maintained essential functionality while removing development artifacts

4. **Socket handlers cleanup**: Removed debug print statements
   - Cleaned up auto-deletion logging in `cleanup_old_games()` function
   - Maintained functionality while removing development noise

### 🔧 **Code Quality Fixes**
1. **ESLint Error Resolution**: Fixed all blocking ESLint errors
   - Removed unused variables: `lastMoveTimestamp`, `getPlayerSymbol`
   - Fixed empty catch blocks with proper comments
   - Removed unused function parameters in event handlers
   - Changed `(error) => {}` to `() => {}` where error wasn't used

2. **React Code Optimization**:
   - Cleaned unused state variables and their setters
   - Simplified event handlers by removing unused parameters
   - Added proper error handling comments in catch blocks
