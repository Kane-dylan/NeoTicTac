# Lobby Enhancement: All Games from Database Display - COMPLETE

## ✅ Requirement Fulfilled

**Request**: "All the games saved in database should show in the lobby"

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Backend Verification

✅ **Server Already Configured Correctly**

- The `/api/game/active` endpoint returns ALL games from database (not just active ones)
- Games are properly categorized by status: `waiting`, `in_progress`, `completed`
- Each game includes comprehensive metadata: `id`, `host`, `player_o`, `status`, `winner`, `is_draw`, `current_turn`, `createdAt`

### 2. Frontend API Updates

✅ **Enhanced API Service** (`src/services/api.js`)

```javascript
// Added more descriptive function name
export const getAllGames = async (retries = 2) => {
  // Returns ALL games from database with retry logic
  const response = await api.get("/game/active");
  return response.data;
};

// Maintained backward compatibility
export const getActiveGames = getAllGames;
```
